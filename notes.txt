Intention is to have:
1 a 12 not row generator: accomplished, via Bostock code.
2 a comparison calculator that calculates the uniqueness  of the note row. Comparisons are of the array: a similar interval next to itself (convert all of array to numbers)
Also perponderance of same interval of all neighbours. Need for loop. Think near neighbour and same interval is less unique.
Is there a modal where there are no unique intervals? What is it?
Above needs to be your model.

Thoughts are sequentially going through intervalsâ€” 
i.e. loop (within loop). Seems more complex.

Revise code. Make more self-referencing code.
